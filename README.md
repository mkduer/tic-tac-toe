# tic_tac_toe
A project generating tic tac toe gameplay and random game states through a Minimax or Negamax Algorithm.

By applying Monte Carlo sampling to generate expected values for random states, a payoff table is created for the next two moves by both players and analysis is done using game theory such as dominant strategies and Nash Equilibrium.
